3. **Attendees**: Only include when attendees are notable policymakers or when attendance itself is newsworthy.

4. **Transcript**: Auto-generated by Whisper. Review for obvious errors but don't aim for perfection. Timestamps are in HH:MM:SS format.

5. **Related Content**: Use Hugo's internal linking format: `[Link Text](/path/to/page)`

6. **Citations**: If referencing specific documents or data mentioned in the meeting, add footnotes:
   ```
   The report showed 96 buildable acres.[^1]

   [^1]: [Document Title](https://example.com/document.pdf)
   ```
